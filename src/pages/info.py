    Each week of the competition (starting with Episode 2), you will submit a fresh set of predictions before the episode airs.
    Your weekly submission must now include **six** predictions:
    - **Star Baker**: Who will be the week's top baker?
    - **Technical Challenge Winner**: Who will come in first in the technical?
    - **Baker Sent Home**: Who will be eliminated from the competition?
    - **Hollywood Handshake**: Will anyone get a handshake? (Optional, high-reward pick).

    - **Predicted Finalists (x2)**: Who will the other two finalists be?

    Your predictions for the season winner and finalists can change week to week as you see how the bakers perform.

    This is where strategy comes in. You get points for correctly predicting the season's winner and finalists, 
    but correct predictions made **earlier in the season are worth exponentially more**.

    Your season outcome predictions are logged each week but scores will only be known when the winner is crowned. 
    At the end of the season, we'll go back and award points for every single time you correctly predicted the outcome.
    - **The Formula**: A correct pick is multiplied by a factor that decreases each week. A correct **winner** prediction is worth **10 base points**, and a correct **finalist** is worth **5**.
    - **Example**: Correctly predicting the season winner in Week 2 is worth **90 points** `((11-2) x 10)`. Waiting until the semi-final in Week 9 to make that same correct prediction is only worth **20 points** `((11-9) x 10)`.
    This is cumulative, so correct predictions in, for example, Weeks 3, 6, 8, and 10 would all be included in your total.
